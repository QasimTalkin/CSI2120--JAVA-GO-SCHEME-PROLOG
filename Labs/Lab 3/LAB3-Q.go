Lab 3: Go
Exercise 1: Channels
The following program is supposed to send the numbers 0 to 20 on a channel, double them in a filter and print them. However, the program does not stop printing (showing many 0).


package main
import (
	"fmt"
)

func sendInt() (ch chan int) {
	defer fmt.Println("Sender ready!")
	ch = make(chan int)
	go func() {
		for i := 0; i < 20; i++ {
			ch <- i
		}
		close(ch)
	}()
	return
}

func filterInt(src <-chan int) (dst chan int) {
	defer fmt.Println("Filter ready!")
	dst = make(chan int)
	go func() {
		defer close(dst)
		open := true
		for open {
			var i int
			i, open = <-src

			if open {
				i *= 2
				dst <- i
			}
		}
	}()
	return
}
Correct the main routine (and only the main routine - lambdas are ok):

func main() {
	src := sendInt()
	dst := filterInt(src)
	for {
		i := <-dst
		fmt.Printf("%d ", i)
	}
	fmt.Println()
}
Exercise 2: Errors
The following routine calculates the square root of a number and divides the result. It can therefore fail when the number is negative or when it divides by zero. Use the two errors in the routine rootDivN by implementing the error interface for the errors and extend the main program to distinguish the two errors by their type and print a corresponding message. You are not allowed to change the function prototype of rootDivN.


package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

type NegError struct {
	num float64 // negative number
}

type Div0Error struct {
}

func rootDivN(num float64, n int) (res float64, err error) {
	if num < 0.0 {
		return
	}
	if n == 0 {
		return
	}
	res = math.Sqrt(num) / float64(n)
	return
}

func main() {
	divs := []int{2, 10, 3, 0}
	nums := []float64{511.8, 0.65, -3.0, 2.123}

	for i, num := range nums {
		fmt.Printf("%d) sqrt(%f)/%d = ", i, num, divs[i])
		res, err := rootDivN(num, divs[i])
		if err == nil {
			fmt.Printf("%f\n", res)
		}
	}
}
Desired Output:

0) sqrt(511.800000)/2 = 11.311499
1) sqrt(0.650000)/10 = 0.080623
2) sqrt(-3.000000)/3 = Main NegError: Negative number -3.000000

3) sqrt(2.123000)/0 = Main Div0Error: Division by 0



Exercise 3 and Quiz: Waiting for Go Routines to Finish
Please hand-in the answer to this question as a single go file on Virtual Campus during your lab session but at the latest by Friday 6:00pm! Remember, your submission will only count if you have signed the lab attendance sheet. 

The following program calculates the sum of the square roots of numbers. Each routine runs in its own go routines and sends the message on a dedicated channel back to the main program. The program exits to early. Fix the main routine (and only the main routine) to ensure that it finishes with the last received result (not earlier or later). Also make sure that you receive the results in the order they are calculated and not simply sequential in the order the routines are called.


package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
	"math/rand"
	"time"
)

func numbers(sz int) (res chan float64) {
	res = make(chan float64)
	go func() {
		defer close(res) 
		num := 0.0
		time.Sleep(time.Duration(rand.Intn(1000)) * time.Microsecond)
		for i := 0; i < sz; i++ {
			num += math.Sqrt(math.Abs(rand.Float64()))
		}
		num /= float64(sz)
		res <- num
		return
	}()
	return
}

func main() {
	var nGo int
	rand.Seed(42)
	fmt.Print("Number of Go routines: ")
	fmt.Scanf("%d \n", &nGo)
	res := make([]chan float64, nGo)

	for i := 0; i < nGo; i++ {
		res[i] = numbers(1000)
	}
}
